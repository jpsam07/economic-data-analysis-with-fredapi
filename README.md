# Economic Data Analysis with FRED API

![Unemployment Rate Stock Image](unemployment_rate_stock_image.jpg)

This economic data analysis project makes use of Python for data analysis, and the [FRED API](https://fredhelp.stlouisfed.org/fred/about/about-fred/what-is-fred/) for pulling out USA economic data about unemployment rates and participation rates per US state.

**Note:** I recommend going to the [NBViewer URL](https://nbviewer.org/github/jpsam07/economic-data-analysis-with-fredapi/blob/9eb0c473052cc7bc4d91593b8d1fedc5be763537/economic_data_analysis_with_fredapi.ipynb) provided in the About section of this repository for a better and clearer view of the Jupyter Notebook.

## Request for FRED API Key

To get your own FRED API key:

1. Register for an account in [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/)

2. Go to `My Account > API Keys`

3. Click the Request API Key button

4. Copy the API key generated for your account

After doing those steps, you then have to paste your API key inside a `.py` file within a variable name of your choice.

You can then proceed to import the libraries required for analysis, and the API key from [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/)
