# Economic Data Analysis with FRED API

This economic data analysis project makes use of Python as the programming language for analysis, and the [FRED API](https://fredhelp.stlouisfed.org/fred/about/about-fred/what-is-fred/) for pulling out USA economic data about unemployment rates and participation rates per US state.


> **Note:**
> I recommend going to the [NBViewer URL](https://nbviewer.org/github/jpsam07/economic-data-analysis-with-fredapi/blob/main/economic_data_analysis_with_fredapi.ipynb) provided in the About section of this repository for a better and clearer view of the Jupyter Notebook.
